I had to find a way of developing more of my coding skills by taking on advance projects,
I developed a youtube clone fetching data with youtube Api
This was done with ReactJS (ViteJS) my first time using ViteJS with react.
It feels being able to write the code from scratch and using redux for state management and react router as well
here is the link to the project on vercel https://youtube-clone-project-opal.vercel.app/
