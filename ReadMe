I had to find a way of developing more of my coding skills by taking on advance projects,
I developed a youtube clone fetching data with youtube Api
This was done with ReactJS (ViteJS) my first time using ViteJS with react.
It feels good being able to write the code from scratch using redux for state management and react router as well. And i beleive i can do more after this
here is the link to the project on vercel https://youtube-clone-project-opal.vercel.app/
